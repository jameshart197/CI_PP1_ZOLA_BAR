            <h2>Share Drinks</h2>
            <p>At Zola our inspiration and ethos is based on the very simple concept of sharing. When people share
                drink, or indeed anything else,
                it creates a bond. It inspires conversation, interaction and creates an amtmosphere that is at once both
                comfortable and sociable.
                We were inspired by Spanish Tapas and the unforgettable feeling of going out with a group of friends and
                passing food across the table.
                Going out for a drink is already an important social standard in England, and we wanted to take that a
                step further and introduce sharing
                into that space to create the perfect social atmosphere for creating memories.</p>
